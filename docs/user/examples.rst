Examples
======================

This section will introduce a sample workflow to annotate ORFs in a simple locus using **ORFanage**.
For the sake of keeping this example concise and illustrative, the data is constrained to a single locus and a subset of isoforms all included in the CHESS dataset [#chess]_.

create standardized gtf for input

run orfanage

visualize gtf [#sashimi]_
